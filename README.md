## Movie Review Project

#### This website was developed as part of the "Interactive Design" course curriculum. The goal of the project was to get familiar with the design process of a website; After creating a style tile using Illustrator and Photoshop, and the wireframe with Figma, the website was implemented with DreamWeaver, using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.
