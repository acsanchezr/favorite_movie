## Movie Review Project

#### This website was developed as part of the "Interactive Design" course curriculum. The goal of the project was to get familiar with the design process of a website. After creating a style tile using Illustrator and Photoshop, and the wireframe with Figma, the website was implemented with DreamWeaver, using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.

#### You can see more of the process on my <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/86257969/Pagina-Web-Resena-de-Pelicula-%28Movie-Review-Website%29"> design portfolio </a>, and see it live <a href="https://acsanchezr.github.io/web_2tdc/index.html">here</a>.
